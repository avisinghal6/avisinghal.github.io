		subtitle: "MCS at Rice University",
		description: `
			I am Avi Singhal, I am currently pursuing MS in Computer Science with a specialization in machine learning at Rice
			University. I have undertaken extensive coursework related to the state-of-art technologies and have completed numerous
			projects to put those skills at practical applications and thereby strengthening my skills. I have grown from a novice 
			in this field to a professional in a relatively small span of time, I am now someone who can handle, complete and lead projects
			independently in an efficient manner. I have strong foundations in data structures and algorithms, and enjoy solving
			complex problems, I am proficient in java, python and c++. I prefer to work outside my comfort zone because thats when I feel I am 
			learning the most. I have worked extensively on computer vision, NLP, DL and ML applications. I have experience 
			developing models, frameworks and pipelines for production release. I also have experience working on the ML compiler. I gained 
			industry experience in ML during my software/ML internship at Tetramem (more details in the experience section.).
			Apart from the ML side, I also have experience developing web applications, and I enjoy back-end development primarily because
			I like working on different technologies and deployment schemes. I have developed many web applications and also deployed them 
			(more details in project section). I tend to follow good coding practices and write code that is easy to understand and
			scale. I am passionate about optimizing the work flows and processes, I try to improve the current methods and even create
			new ones to enhance productivity.

		description2:`I believe in order for someone to write truly efficient software, its necessary to understand the underlying hardware and its
		limitations as well. I completed my undergrad in electronics and communication and hence possess the necessary hardware background
		as well which enables to me to write efficient code for specific hardware when needed. I also worked for Texas Instruments
		for a year after my undergrad before starting my Masters. Working at TI enabled me to work across teams and countries to 
		deliver the product. It helped me improve my time management and collaboration skills. `,

		description3:`I am now looking for opportunities where I can leverage my skills and deliver value to the company
		and at the same time have a continuous growth by acquiring new skills. I believe I have the skills and the positive attitude required 
		for excelling in the software/ML domain, I am quick at acquiring new skills and can adapt to a dynamically changing 
		environment.
